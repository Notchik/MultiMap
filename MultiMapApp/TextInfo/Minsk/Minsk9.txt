The Soviet district was founded in 1938 as Voroshilovsky, in modern borders since 1977.

In the 1930s, the formation of Komarovskaya Square (now Yakub Kolas) began. The so-called Komarov's pitchfork (the merger of the former Logoysk and Borisov tracts) was rebuilt and the construction of the Institute of Physical Education began. In 1939, his building was already operational.

Minsk gradually expanded. Considering the significant growth of the capital's population (218 thousand people), the Presidium of the CEC of the BSSR adopted the Resolution on the Formation in the Capital of the Republic of three urban districts: Stalin, Koganovichi and Voroshilovsky (since November 2, 1961 - the Soviet district). In connection with the expansion of the city Soviet District was divided twice. It was from its composition that Pervomaisky first formed, and then the Central districts of the city of Minsk (1969).

Residential houses with various configurations of plans (curvilinear, with a break) are built in combination with low-rise public buildings - schools, preschool institutions, trade and public centers [5].
