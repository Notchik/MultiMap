The church was erected in the XII century [1]. There are disagreements about a more accurate dating. According to N. N. Voronin, the church was erected in the second quarter of the 12th century. PA Rappoport attributed construction to the third quarter of the 12th century. Similarly, P. A. Rappoport assumed that the architect of the Grodno church could be Peter Miloneg [2].

The generally accepted date is the destruction of the temple - 1183 year. The Ipatiev Chronicle contains a reference to the fire in Grodno. According to the annals: "All that is in the city and the church of the stone are born from the lightning and the thunder of thunder." According to N. N. Voronin in this annalistic message, it is a question of the destruction of one temple [the source does not indicate 1101 days]. The destroyed walls of the temple were later covered and served as the basis for the construction of the Upper church: a small Gothic church, the time of Grand Duke Vitovt [3].

During excavation, in the territory of the Grodno Detinets, in 1932-1933, the church was discovered by Y. Yadkovsky and was named after the location in the excavation of the Lower.

Currently, the Lower Church is covered with a pavilion. They are shown to the visitors of the Grodno State Historical and Archaeological Museum.
