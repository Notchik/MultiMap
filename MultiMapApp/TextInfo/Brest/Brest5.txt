Brest Fortress, formerly known as Brest-Litovsk Fortress, is a 19th-century Russian fortress in Brest, 
Belarus, the former Byelorussian SSR. In 1965, the title Hero Fortress was given to the Fortress to commemorate the 
defence of the frontier stronghold during the first week of the German-Soviet War, when Nazi Germany invaded the 
Soviet Union on June 22, 1941, with the launch of World War II's Operation Barbarossa. The title Hero Fortress 
corresponds to the title Hero City, that was awarded to an eventual total of twelve Soviet cities. Brest Fortress 
is situated at an altitude of 135 meters
