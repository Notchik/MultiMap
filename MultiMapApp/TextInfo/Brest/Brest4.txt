Brest is a city (population 340,141 in 2016) in Belarus at the border with Poland opposite the Polish city of Terespol,
 where the Bug and Mukhavets rivers meet. It is the capital city of the Brest Region.
The city of Brest is a historic site of many cultures. It was the location of important 
historical events such as the Union of Brest and Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. The Brest Fortress was recognized by the 
Soviet Union as the Hero Fortress in honor of the defense of Brest Fortress in June 1941.
During medieval times, the city was part of the Kingdom of Poland from 1020 until 1319 when 
it was taken by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It became part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1569. 
As a result of the Partitions of Poland, it was incorporated into the Russian Empire in 1795. After World War I,
 the city returned to Second Polish Republic. During the Invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in 
1939 the city was first captured by the Wehrmacht and soon passed on to the USSR in accordance with German-Soviet Frontier Treaty.
 In 1941 it was taken again by the Nazis during Operation Barbarossa. After the war, once the new boundaries between the 
USSR and Poland were ratified, the city became part of the Soviet BSSR until the breakup of the country in 1991. 
It is now a part of an independent Belarus.
