Agro-town is located 6 km north-west of Brest city center, actually being its north-western suburb. From the territory of Brest proper, Kleiniki separates the Northern semicircle of the M1 highway. In 3-5 km to the south and west there is a border with Poland, which runs along the Western Bug River. The tributary of the Buga Lesnaya flows along the northern outskirts of the village. Local roads lead from Kleinikov to the villages of Bolshye Motykaly and Terebun. At the eastern outskirts of the village there is the Skoki railway platform (the Belostok-Brest line)
